# Scape-GPT

## Overview

Scape-GPT is my final project for the completion of a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Universidad Nacional del Sur. The primary objective of this project was to assess whether ChatGPT could solve, or assist a user in solving, the types of problems typically encountered in an escape room. These problems often require a combination of environmental awareness and logical reasoning to identify patterns that lead to solutions.

The project also explores the integration of low-cost Virtual Reality (VR) with ChatGPT, enabling cooperation between the user and the AI assistant through voice commands. The project was developed using C# in the Unity 3D platform, with Google Cardboard used for VR implementation.

For voice-based communication between the user and the AI assistant, the project makes use of the "Speech And Text in Unity iOS and Unity Android" package, developed by khanhuitse05. Additionally, a Bluetooth controller with a joystick and at least 1 button is required for the player to move and interact with objects within the virtual environment.

## Features

-  ChatGPT Integration: Implements ChatGPT as an in-game assistant to help solve escape room challenges.
-  Voice Commands: Allows players to interact with the AI assistant using voice input.
-  Virtual Reality: Utilizes Google Cardboard to create an immersive low cost VR experience.
-  Logical Problem Solving: Focuses on problems that require pattern recognition and logical reasoning, typical of escape room scenarios.

## Installation and Setup

Clone the repository:
-  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scape-gpt.git
-  Open the project in Unity 3D.
-  In the ChatGPT.cs file, located at Assets/Scripts/ChatGPT.cs, replace YOUR_API_KEY at line 18 with your actual OpenAI API key
-    private string apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
-  Build and run the project on a compatible Android or iOS device with Google Cardboard.

## Dependencies

Unity 3D: Version 2020.3 or later.
Google Cardboard SDK: For VR support.
Speech And Text in Unity iOS and Unity Android: For voice interaction.
